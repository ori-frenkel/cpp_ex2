Explanation about your exercise:
In this exercise, I implemented a Fractal drawer -
A program that get as input a fractal type and its dimension, and print it.
I design the program using OOP design.
There is an abstract class - 'Fractal' - because there is no logic in creating a general Fractal.
In addition, I decide to implement a factory design pattern, using the class FactoryFractal
because in the program we creating a lot of different type of fractal, and using factory design
make the good look clearer and easier to expand later on.
In my first attempt of printing Fractal, I tried using a recursion, I stumble into a problem,
that I got the right printing, but with a '\n' between them, which can be solved by not printing
straight forward, and saving the fractal in vector and than printing the vector.
I decided that I prefer to straight forward printing and not to save the Fractal in buffer and then
printing.
So after some thinking, I saw that there is a pattern in the fractals, for example
in fractal of type 1, if we would look at the fractal as a grind of x,y,
than x % 3 == 1 and y % 3 == 1 is always empty, so I implemented the draw function using this
idea and for loops.
